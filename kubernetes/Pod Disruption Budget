Pod Disruption Budget
to get node from not ready to schedule to normal
#kubectl uncordon nodename

An Application Owner can create a PodDisruptionBudget object (PDB) for each application.
A PDB limits the number pods of a replicated application that are down simultaneously from voluntary disruptions. 
For example, a quorum-based application would like to ensure that the number of replicas running is never brought below the number needed for a quorum. 
A web front end might want to ensure that the number of replicas serving load never falls below a certain percentage of the total.
