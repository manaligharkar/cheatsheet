Defenetion::A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.
You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.
