      =========================================================================
      In the configuration file, you can see that the Pod has a single Container. The periodSeconds field specifies that the kubelet should perform a liveness probe 
      every 5 seconds. The initialDelaySeconds field tells the kubelet that it should wait 5 seconds before performing the first probe. 
      To perform a probe, the kubelet executes the command cat /tmp/healthy in the target container. If the command succeeds, it returns 0, and the kubelet 
      considers the container to be alive and healthy. If the command returns a non-zero value, the kubelet kills the container and restarts it.
      ====================================================================
initialDelaySeconds: Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness or readiness probes are initiated. Defaults to 0 seconds. Minimum value is 0.
periodSeconds: How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default to 10 seconds. Minimum value is 1.
timeoutSeconds: Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1.
successThreshold: Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness and startup Probes. Minimum value is 1.
failureThreshold: When a probe fails, Kubernetes will try failureThreshold times before giving up. Giving up in case of liveness probe means restarting the container. In case of readiness probe the Pod will be marked Unready. Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1.
