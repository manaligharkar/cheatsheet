*There are three built-in build lifecycles: default, clean and site.
The default lifecycle handles your project deployment, the clean lifecycle handles project cleaning, while the site lifecycle handles the creation of your project's web site,kind of report.
*default lifecycle comprises of the following phases (for a complete list of the lifecycle phases, refer to the Lifecycle Reference):
validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile - compile the source code of the project
test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
*pom.xml-->A Project Object Model or POM is the fundamental unit of work in Maven. 
It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. 
It contains default values for most projects. Examples for this is the build directory, which is target; the source directory, which is src/main/java; the test source directory, which is src/test/java; and so on. When executing a task or goal, Maven looks for the POM in the current directory. It reads the POM, gets the needed configuration information, then executes the goal.
*D:\Software\Maven\apache-maven-3.8.3\conf\settings.xml--<localRepository>/path/to/local/repo</localRepository>
The path to the local repository maven will use to store artifacts. --> Default: ${user.home}/.m2/repository
