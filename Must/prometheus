Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter for server level and OS level metrics with configurable metric collectors. 
It helps us in measuring various server resources such as RAM, disk space, and CPU utilization. 
Node exporter is a good solution to collect all the Linux server related metrics and statistics for monitoring.

Here, you will learn how to install the node exporter manually as well by Ansible playbook on a Linux server to export all node level metrics to the Prometheus server.

Prerequisites
Prometheus server to be up and running to receive Node Exporter metrics.
In the inbound rules of the server firewall, port 9100 should be opened for Prometheus server IP as Prometheus reads metrics on this port.
