Application Programming Interface:Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. 
Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API.
What Is an Example of an API?
When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. 
The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone. 
The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. 
This is what an API is - all of this happens via API.
