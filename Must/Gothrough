k8s Architecture:
Redundancy, deploy rplicas on multiple hosts--So managing is done by k8s
Orchestion--desired/current
dirrenece-->swarm/k8s--> swarm is basic , rollbase access control ,  cannnot automaticaly scale up instances

master -> apiserver/etcd/scheduler/controller
kubectl --> talk to apiservr, scheduler--checks node avaibilty as per requiremet/due to taint defined on master/work wil b assioned on 
worker node,duty of controller is to see desired state is acheived or not
etcd--acts like databse--stores values of cluster is no-sql database key-value pair

 --> worker1 worker2 worker3
worker--kubelet/crE(container runtime engine)/kube-proxy
=================================================
==============
merge/rebase-->designed for same purpose tahts is to integrate one branch to another branch, But they do it in diffrent ways
If i m working on new feature peoject on dedicated branch and one of my team member does commit on develop branch and that new commit is relevant to feature which i am working on then i would need to incororate new commits my feature branch.
Merge--new merge comit on my feature-thats ties historie of both braches
Rebase--it moves feature branch on tip of commit of devop branch
it moves entire feature brach to begin on tip of development branch incorporting all new commits.--clean project history. 
Git sqaush--> cmbining commits --that can be achive with rebase --interactive--rewite repo history
master--prod code+develop-preprod code/
new feature--create brach from dev brach---pul crequest and thats is merged into dev bracnch nad that feaute branch will be deleted
--->release/hotfix/feature
=================================
helm chart-promethesu
serviceaccount/namespace/role/stateful/services/persistance volumes--objects
what r operater-->Operator use custome resouce defenation--their own custom script--they take care of pvc/pv atumaticly, regular backup, if u want to add configuration--so no need bring down pod
So operaor wil continusly motor chnages in confuration and apply 
offical oprtor--good to use--
https based app--end point /metric /health-which doen nt need authorization, if secure jw token, if data coming as json, we need to chnage data --many exporter do that
json exporter wil take input json and it convert which promQL wil analyze
types of metrics in prom--> 4->1.guess 2.count 3.histogram 4.summary
-----------------------------
resource quota limit resouces to namespace--
Need to read--resouce quota/rollbase access/operator-alertmanager
**Role Based Access Control in Kubernetes(RBAC)
Role:get,list
resources:pod,volume
2 types--
clusterrolebinding more powerful as they apply to all namespaces in cluster
rolebinding--its specific to specific namespace.-->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLktpM--0jA
