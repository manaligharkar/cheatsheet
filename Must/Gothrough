k8s Architecture:
Redundancy, deploy rplicas on multiple hosts--So managing is done by k8s
Orchestion--desired/current
dirrenece-->swarm/k8s--> swarm is basic , rollbase access control ,  cannnot automaticaly scale up instances

master -> apiserver/etcd/scheduler/controller
kubectl --> talk to apiservr, scheduler--checks node avaibilty as per requiremet/due to taint defined on master/work wil b assioned on 
worker node,duty of controller is to see desired state is acheived or not
etcd--acts like databse--stores values of cluster is no-sql database key-value pair

 --> worker1 worker2 worker3
worker--kubelet/crE(container runtime engine)/kube-proxy
